# Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography, Sections 2.3 and 2.4
- # 2.3 One-Way Functions:
- One-way functions are mathematical functions that are easy to compute in one direction but difficult to reverse.
- uThese functions are essential in cryptography for secure operations like hashing and public-key encryption.
- Examples include multiplication of large prime numbers, where it’s easy to compute the product but hard to reverse-engineer the factors.
- One-way functions provide the foundation for various encryption protocols, including digital signatures and password security.
- # 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions:
- A hash function converts data of any size into a fixed-size string, typically a sequence of numbers and letters.
- Hash functions are used to ensure data integrity, as even a small change in input results in a drastically different hash.
- Important properties of hash functions include pre-image resistance (it’s hard to reverse the hash), collision resistance (two inputs shouldn't produce the same hash), and fast computation.
- Hash functions like MD5 and SHA-256 are widely used for verifying the integrity of data, creating digital signatures, and securing passwords.
- # Forbes 2019: Jackpotting ATMs 
- Jackpotting is a hacking technique used to make ATMs dispense large amounts of cash.
- Techniques: Attackers often physically install malicious hardware (e.g., black box devices) or software to override the ATM’s operation.
- Weak Points: ATMs with outdated software or unpatched systems are vulnerable to these attacks.
- Prevention: Banks are advised to update ATM software regularly and monitor unusual transactions or physical tampering.
- Disobey 2019: This presentation highlighted how easy it can be to exploit ATMs if proper security protocols aren’t followed, with real-world examples of jackpotting attacks.
