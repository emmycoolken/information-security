# Disobey 2024:
Disobey is an annual cybersecurity conference held in Helsinki, Finland
The event features presentations, workshops, a CTF challenge, and vendor booths
Over 1800 visitors attended in 2024, organized by a team of 100+ volunteers
Presentation topics vary widely in skill level and background knowledge required
Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited
Provides a refresher on essential command line concepts and skills
Useful for both beginners and experienced users to solidify their understanding
Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography (voluntary reading)
Covers one-way hash functions and public-key cryptography
Provides background on core cryptographic primitives
Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (voluntary reading)
Introduces the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and blockchain technology
Explains key concepts like transactions, proof-of-work, and incentives
OverTheWire: Bandit (levels 0-4)
An online wargame to learn command line skills through challenges
Levels 0-4 provide an introduction to the basics
Disabling networking
Demonstrates that packets cannot be sent or received when networking is disabled
Analyzing the 'ping' command output shows the connection is not working
Port scanning localhost
Scans the local machine for open ports using 'nmap'
Analyzing the results shows which ports are listening for connections
Installing a daemon
Installs a server application like Apache or SSH
Rescanning with the daemon running shows the open ports it is listening on
UnderTheWire: Century (voluntary bonus)
A similar wargame to OverTheWire but focused on Windows PowerShell
My own idea:
Follow cybersecurity blogs, podcasts, and conferences to stay up-to-date on the latest trends, tools, and techniques in the field. Some good resources include Schneier on Security, Darknet Diaries, and DEF CON.
