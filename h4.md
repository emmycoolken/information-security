# A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
- Improper enforcement of access controls can allow unauthorized users to access restricted resources.
- Common issues include missing or ineffective authorization checks.
- Causes: Weak access control policies or failures in enforcing them.
- Examples: Accessing another user’s account by changing the URL, modifying parameters, or bypassing admin panels.
- Prevention: Implement proper access control mechanisms, validate permissions on both client-side and server-side, and regularly audit access controls.
# A03:2021 – Injection
- This vulnerability occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- SQL injection is a common type, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
# A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
- Misconfigurations can occur at any level of an application stack, including the web server, database, and application framework.
- Default settings, incomplete setups, and overly verbose error messages are common issues.
- Overview: Occurs when security settings are not properly defined or enforced.
- Causes: Default configurations, incomplete configurations, open cloud storage, or error messages exposing sensitive information.
- Examples: Leaving default admin credentials, unnecessary features enabled, or misconfigured content security policies.
- Prevention: Regularly update configurations, disable unused features, and perform security hardening.
# A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Using components with known vulnerabilities can compromise application security.
- Regular updates and patching are essential to mitigate this risk.
Tasks Overview
# a) Goat - Installing WebGoat 2023.4
-WebGoat is an educational platform for learning web application security. It's used to practice security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
# b) F12 - Solve WebGoat 2023.4: General: Developer Tools
- Used developer tools (F12 in Firefox or Chromium) to inspect elements, view console logs, and manipulate elements in real-time.
- Learned how to inspect HTTP requests and responses, analyze cookies, and debug JavaScript issues directly from the browser.

# c) Not Outdated - Update Linux OS and Applications
- Ran the following commands to update all system software:
- sudo apt-get update: Fetches the latest list of available updates.
- sudo apt-get dist-upgrade: Installs the newest versions of installed packages, updating all necessary dependencies.
Ensured all installed applications were up-to-date to mitigate the risk of running vulnerable and outdated components.
# d) Sequel - Solve SQLZoo: SELECT Basics & SELECT from World
# Task: Practiced fundamental SQL queries in SQLZoo to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Skills Learned:
- SELECT: Extract specific data from a database.
- Filtering rows using WHERE.
- Sorting results with ORDER BY.
- Joins to combine data from multiple tables.
Grouping results using GROUP BY.
# e) Johnny Tables - SQL Injection Vulnerability in WHERE Clause
- Solved the SQL Injection vulnerability challenge at Portswigger Labs.
- Process:
- Injected SQL code into a vulnerable WHERE clause of a query.
- Retrieved hidden data by manipulating the query.
- Used basic SQL Injection techniques like using ' OR 1=1-- to bypass authentication or extract data.
# Key Learnings:
- SQL injections occur when user input is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Prevented by using prepared statements and parameterized queries.
# m) Voluntary Bonus: WebGoat SQL Injection
- Solved SQL Injection exercises in WebGoat.
Techniques Practiced:
- techIdentifying vulnerable fields.
- Crafting SQL queries to extract, update, or delete data from a backend database.
# n) Voluntary Bonus: Portswigger Apprentice Labs
- Solved some beginner-level labs focused on SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Learned different injection techniques and how to prevent them by securing input fields.
# Conclusion:
This task helped me gain a deeper understanding of various web vulnerabilities, especially those listed in the OWASP Top 10, and how to practically identify and mitigate them. I learned the importance of keeping software updated, securing access controls, and protecting against injection attacks, which are key in developing secure web applications.
