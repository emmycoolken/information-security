# Definition of Cryptography: Cryptography is the science of securing communication by converting information into a secure format (encryption) that can only be understood by intended parties.
Historical Context: Cryptography has been used since ancient times (e.g., Caesar cipher) but has evolved significantly, especially with the advent of computers.
# Types of Cryptography:
# Symmetric Cryptography: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric Cryptography: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) where the public key encrypts, and the private key decrypts.
# Key Concepts:
- Confidentiality: Ensures information is accessible only to authorized users.
- Integrity: Protects against unauthorized alteration of data.
- Authentication: Verifies the identity of the participants in a communication.
- Non-repudiation: Ensures that someone cannot deny the authenticity of their digital signature or the sending of a message.
- The Role of Algorithms: Different algorithms (like DES, RSA) are used to ensure these properties are met, balancing security and performance.
- Applications of Cryptography: Used in secure communications, digital signatures, secure storage, authentication systems, and more.

This article is focused on using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption with the 'gpg' tool to encrypt and sign messages:

# GPG (GNU Privacy Guard): A free implementation of OpenPGP standard that allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and sign messages.
Public Key Cryptography: PGP uses public and private keys, where a public key is used to encrypt a message, and a private key is used to decrypt it.
# Steps to Encrypt and Decrypt:
- Key Generation: Generate a public-private key pair using gpg --gen-key.
- Sharing Public Key: Export and share your public key so others can send you encrypted messages.
- Encrypting a Message: Use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message, ensuring only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key.
- Signing a Message: The sender signs the message with their private key, allowing the recipient to verify the sender’s identity with their public key.
- Decrypting: Use your private key to decrypt a message that was encrypted with your public key.
- Use Cases: PGP is used for securing emails, sensitive file transfers, and communication channels, providing both encryption and authentication.
- Subtask (a): Encrypt and decrypt a message using gnupg (PGP public key cryptography)
Here’s a guide to encrypting and decrypting messages using gnupg (GNU Privacy Guard) and PGP:

# Install GnuPG (if not installed):

- For Linux: sudo apt-get install gnupg
- For Windows: Download and install GPG4Win.
