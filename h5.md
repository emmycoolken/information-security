# Definition of Cryptography: Cryptography is the science of securing communication by converting information into a secure format (encryption) that can only be understood by intended parties.
Historical Context: Cryptography has been used since ancient times (e.g., Caesar cipher) but has evolved significantly, especially with the advent of computers.
# Types of Cryptography:
# Symmetric Cryptography: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric Cryptography: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) where the public key encrypts, and the private key decrypts.
# Key Concepts:
- Confidentiality: Ensures information is accessible only to authorized users.
- Integrity: Protects against unauthorized alteration of data.
- Authentication: Verifies the identity of the participants in a communication.
- Non-repudiation: Ensures that someone cannot deny the authenticity of their digital signature or the sending of a message.
- The Role of Algorithms: Different algorithms (like DES, RSA) are used to ensure these properties are met, balancing security and performance.
- Applications of Cryptography: Used in secure communications, digital signatures, secure storage, authentication systems, and more.
- Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
This article is focused on using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption with the 'gpg' tool to encrypt and sign messages:

# GPG (GNU Privacy Guard): A free implementation of OpenPGP standard that allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and sign messages.
Public Key Cryptography: PGP uses public and private keys, where a public key is used to encrypt a message, and a private key is used to decrypt it.
# Steps to Encrypt and Decrypt:
- Key Generation: Generate a public-private key pair using gpg --gen-key.
- Sharing Public Key: Export and share your public key so others can send you encrypted messages.
- Encrypting a Message: Use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message, ensuring only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key.
- Signing a Message: The sender signs the message with their private key, allowing the recipient to verify the sender’s identity with their public key.
- Decrypting: Use your private key to decrypt a message that was encrypted with your public key.
- Use Cases: PGP is used for securing emails, sensitive file transfers, and communication channels, providing both encryption and authentication.
- Subtask (a): Encrypt and decrypt a message using gnupg (PGP public key cryptography)
Here’s a guide to encrypting and decrypting messages using gnupg (GNU Privacy Guard) and PGP:

# Install GnuPG (if not installed):

- For Linux: sudo apt-get install gnupg
- For Windows: Download and install GPG4Win.
# Generate a key pair: gpg --gen-key
Follow the prompts to create your key (name, email, passphrase).

# Export your public key (to share with others):
gpg --armor --export your_email@emmycool.com > public_key.asc
# Encrypt a message (using the recipient's public key):

- First, import the recipient’s public key:
gpg --import recipient_public_key.asc
- Then, encrypt the message
echo "Secret message" | gpg --encrypt --armor -r recipient_email@exampleemmycool.com > encrypted_message.asc
- Decrypt the message:
gpg --decrypt encrypted_message.asc
- sign a message
echo "Message to sign" | gpg --clearsign > signed_message.asc

The recipient can verify your signature with your public key.

# Subtask (b): Password manager, open and cloudless
1. Choose a password manager:

- KeePassXC: A free, open-source password manager that doesn’t rely on the cloud. It stores your passwords locally on your device and encrypts them with strong algorithms (AES-256).
2. Install KeePassXC:

- For Linux: sudo apt install keepassxc
- For macOS: brew install keepassxc
- For Windows: Download from the official website.
3. Demonstrate its use:

## Creating a New Database:
-Open KeePassXC, and create a new database. Secure it with a strong master password.
## Add Entries:
- You can now add usernames, passwords, and URLs to your database.
## Generate Strong Passwords:
- KeePassXC has a built-in password generator to create strong, random passwords.
## Auto-fill:
- KeePassXC can auto-fill login credentials into web browsers (using browser extensions).
# Why a password manager is needed:

- Protection Against Weak Passwords: Many people reuse passwords or use weak ones, which can easily be cracked. A password manager generates and stores strong, unique passwords for each account.
- Protection Against Phishing: Password managers help avoid phishing by auto-filling passwords only on legitimate websites, preventing users from entering credentials on fraudulent sites.
- Protection Against Keyloggers: Since the manager auto-fills passwords, there is no need to manually type them, reducing the risk of keylogger attacks.
- Secure Storage: All your passwords are stored in an encrypted database, making it difficult for attackers to gain access even if your device is compromised.
