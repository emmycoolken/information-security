# 1. Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About TOR
- Anonymity: TOR (The Onion Router) is a network that allows users to browse the web anonymously by routing traffic through multiple servers (nodes) before reaching the destination.
- Security: While TOR provides strong anonymity, it doesn’t make you invincible. Vulnerabilities like browser exploits can still compromise users' anonymity.
- Legal Use: TOR is legal in most countries, including Finland, and is often used by journalists, activists, and those concerned with privacy.
- Onion Routing: The system relies on "onion routing," where data is encrypted and sent through a network of relays. Each relay knows only the previous and next step, but not the whole route.
- Exit Nodes: The last relay in the TOR network is called the exit node, which decrypts the final layer of encryption and sends the data to its destination. This is often where attacks can happen.
- Deep Web Access: TOR provides access to ".onion" websites, which are not indexed by regular search engines and are part of the deep web.
- Not Just for Criminals: While TOR has been associated with illegal activities, it is also used for legitimate purposes like protecting privacy, evading censorship, and securing communication for journalists.
# 2. Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser
- Introduction: TOR enables anonymous browsing by encrypting and bouncing communications through a distributed network of relays.
- History and Intended Use of The Onion Router: Originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the mid-1990s, TOR’s primary goal was to protect intelligence communications. It was later released for broader use, catering to those needing privacy and anonymity (e.g., journalists, activists, whistleblowers).
- How The Onion Router Works: TOR anonymizes users by sending traffic through multiple encrypted layers, hence the name "onion routing." Each layer is stripped away by each relay, but no single node knows both the origin and destination.
- Tracking Criminals Using TOR: Law enforcement agencies often face difficulties tracking criminals who exploit TOR’s anonymity. However, through sophisticated techniques such as traffic analysis or exploiting vulnerabilities in users' browsers, authorities have occasionally been able to de-anonymize individuals using TOR for illegal purposes.

# a) Install TOR Browser and Access TOR Network
## Step-by-Step Installation:

- I Downloaded the TOR Browser:

- I Visit the official TOR website: https://www.torproject.org/.
- I Download the appropriate version for my operating system Windows
- I Installed the Browser:

- I Run the installer and followed the instructions, and completed the setup.
Once installed, I launched the browser, and it automatically connected to the TOR network by routing my connection through several relays.
