# Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains"-  **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** APTs are sophisticated, well-resourced adversaries who conduct prolonged campaigns to steal sensitive data. Traditional network defense methods, which primarily focus on vulnerabilities, are often insufficient against APTs.

- **Intelligence-Driven Defense:** This approach focuses on understanding and anticipating adversary tactics. By studying the entire lifecycle of an intrusion, defenders can better detect and mitigate threats. The article emphasizes creating a feedback loop where each attempted intrusion strengthens defenses against future attacks.

- **Kill Chain Model:** The kill chain consists of phases including reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Effective defense requires disrupting the kill chain at any stage, thereby thwarting the adversary.

- **Indicator Life Cycle:** Indicators (pieces of information that describe an intrusion) are categorized into atomic, computed, and behavioral types. These indicators are used to detect and analyze threats and are constantly refined through a process known as the indicator life cycle.

- **Courses of Action Matrix:** This matrix aligns defensive capabilities with specific phases of the kill chain, suggesting actions like detection, denial, disruption, and destruction at each stage to enhance network resilience.

- **Intrusion Reconstruction:** The ability to fully analyze and understand past intrusions is crucial. By reconstructing an intrusion, defenders can identify and mitigate vulnerabilities at earlier stages in future attacks.

- **Insight/Question:** Given the complexity and evolving nature of APTs, how can organizations ensure that their intelligence-driven defense strategies remain adaptive and effective over time? What role can AI play in automating the detection and response processes across the kill chain?
